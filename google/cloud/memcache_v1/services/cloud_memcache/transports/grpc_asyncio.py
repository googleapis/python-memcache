class CloudMemcacheGrpcAsyncIOTransport(CloudMemcacheTransport):
    """gRPC AsyncIO backend transport for CloudMemcache.

    Configures and manages Cloud Memorystore for Memcached instances.

    The ``memcache.googleapis.com`` service implements the Google Cloud
    Memorystore for Memcached API and defines the following resource
    model for managing Memorystore Memcached (also called Memcached
    below) instances:

    -  The service works with a collection of cloud projects, named:
       ``/projects/*``
    -  Each project has a collection of available locations, named:
       ``/locations/*``
    -  Each location has a collection of Memcached instances, named:
       ``/instances/*``
    -  As such, Memcached instances are resources of the form:
       ``/projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}``

    Note that location_id must be a GCP ``region``; for example:

    -  ``projects/my-memcached-project/locations/us-central1/instances/my-memcached``

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
